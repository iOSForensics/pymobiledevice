* M2Crypto
* construct >= 2.9.29
* pyasn1
* future
* six
* biplist
* usbmuxd must be installed and running

## Lockdownd.py [com.apple.lockownd]

This script can be used in order to pair with the device & starts other services.

*Other services can only be accessed after successful pairing. Succesful pairing requires the device to be unlocked and
the user to click
"Trust this device" on their phone screen.*

## afc.py [com.apple.afc]

This service is responsible for things such as copying music and photos. AFC Clients like iTunes are allowed accessing
to a “jailed” or limited area of the device filesystem. Actually, AFC clients can only access certain files, namely
those located in the Media folder.

## house_arrest.py [com.apple.mobile.house_arrest]

This service allows accessing to AppStore applications folders and their content. In other words, by using an AFC
client, a user/attacker can download the application resources and data. It also includes the “default preferences” file
where credentials are sometimes stored.

## installation_proxy.py [com.apple.mobile.installation_proxy]

The installation proxy manages applications on a device. It allows execution of the following commands:

- List installed applications
- List archived applications
- ...

## mobilebackup.py & mobilebackup2.py [ com.apple.mobilebackup & com.apple.mobilebackup2 ]

Those services are used by iTunes to backup the device.

## diagnostics_relay.py [com.apple.mobile.diagnostics_relay]

The diagnostic relay allows requesting iOS diagnostic information. The service handles the following actions:

- [ Sleep ]Puts the device into deep sleep mode and disconnects from host.
- [ Restart ] Restart the device and optionally show a user notification.
- [ Shutdown ] Shutdown of the device and optionally show a user notification.
- [ NAND, IORegistry, GasGauge, MobileGestalt ] Querry diagnostic informations.
- ...

## filerelay.py [com.apple.mobile.file_relay]

Depending of the iOS version, the file relay service may support the following commands:
Accounts, AddressBook, AppleSupport, AppleTV, Baseband, Bluetooth, CrashReporter, CLTM Caches, CoreLocation, DataAccess,
DataMigrator, demod, Device-o-Matic, EmbeddedSocial, FindMyiPhone GameKitLogs, itunesstored, IORegUSBDevice, HFSMeta,
Keyboard, Lockdown, MapsLogs, MobileAsset, MobileBackup, MobileCal, MobileDelete, MobileInstallation, MobileMusicPlayer,
MobileNotes, NANDDebugInfo Network, Photos, SafeHarbor, SystemConfiguration, tmp, Ubiquity, UserDatabases, VARFS, VPN,

All the files returned by the iPhone are stored in clear text in a gziped CPIO archive.

## pcapd.py [com.apple.pcapd]

Starting iOS 5, apple added a remote virtual interface (RVI) facility that allows mirroring networks trafic from an iOS
device. On Mac OSX the virtual interface can be enabled with the rvictl command. This script allows to use this service
on other systems.
